# DNACipher Project

## Overview
DNACipher is a Java-based application designed for encrypting and decrypting text using a unique combination of biological concepts and classical cryptography. The application converts plaintext to a DNA sequence, applies amino acid conversion, and then encrypts it using the Hill Cipher technique.

## Features
- Text to DNA sequence conversion
- DNA to Amino Acid conversion
- Hill Cipher encryption and decryption
- Binary and text conversions

## How to Use
To use DNACipher, clone this repository and run the `DNACipher.java` file. The application will guide you through the process of inputting text, encrypting it, and then decrypting it back to the original text.

## Components
The project consists of several key classes:
- `DNACipher`: The main class that orchestrates the encryption and decryption processes.
- `TextPreprocessor`: Handles the preprocessing of text (e.g., trimming).
- `BinaryConverter`: Converts text to binary and vice versa.
- `DNAConverter`: Converts binary strings to DNA sequences and vice versa.
- `AminoAcidConverter`: Converts DNA sequences to amino acids and vice versa.
- `HillCipher`: Performs the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption.

## Diagrams
This repository also includes various UML and flow diagrams to represent the structure and flow of the application:

1. **Class Diagram**: Shows the structure of the classes and their relationships.
2. **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates the sequence of method calls for encryption and decryption.
3. **Use Case Diagram**: Represents the use cases of the application.
4. **Activity Diagrams**: Detail the workflow for both encryption and decryption processes.
5. **Component Diagram**: Describes the organization of the software components.
6. **State Diagram**: Shows the state transitions in the encryption and decryption process.
7. **Object Diagram**: Provides a snapshot of the system's objects at runtime.

## Setup and Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
